# CSC-313-Projects
An assortment for several of the projects I made for CSC 313 at EKU during the Spring 2019 semester. 

For CSC 313 Homework 6:

This is a simple website for a ficticious "Kentucky Botanical Society" we made for class.

To run: Open the "home.html" file in your preffered web browser. Alt. You may also open any of the other ".html" files, as each have hyperlinks in the header menu that leads to all other webpages for the website.
You man navigate it like any normal website.
