            <p><b class = "first_word">Welcome!</b>
                To the official website for the Kentucky Botanical Society. Among the world's botanical guilds, we rank around #17. However, we assure you, the 16 <i>supposed</i> superior botanical societies are, in actuality, far inferior to us. By our own ranking, we have been #1 for 60+ years running. Our ranking methods are far more accurate as we remove any negative points from employee casualties that the <i>official</i> rankings take into considerate.</p>
            
            <p><b class ="first_word">Who are we?</b>
                A fine question, indeed. Well, the best place to start is usually the beginning. No one is quite sure who our founder was. There are many legends of them. Some propose there never was a founder; that this society merely came into being spontaniously. Others propose it was Arnold, who works part time at the local Dairy Queen. As everyone always remembers him being here.<img title="Arnold" src="arnold.png"> 
                Perhaps we may well never know the truth.</p>
            <p>Regardless of our origin, we have a mission. What that mission is is not entirely clear. If you asked  our members they would likely give a different answer every time. (Except for Arnold. I don't believe he's ever spoken to anyone.) Regardless, regardless. We are a society of botanist. That's what it says on the sign.</p>
            
            <p><b class = "first_word">What do we do?</b>
                No one here is quite sure what we are <i>supposed</i> to be doing. There are certainly a lot of plants here. So most of us just tend to them. I don't recall anyone every planting anything, so where the plants come from is anyone's guess. Everyone I've spoken to had no iterest in gardening or plants in general before joining. But as soon as they joined they, strangly, felt compelled by <i>something</i> to tend to the plants.<br> <img id = "lalign" title="I like plants" src="plant_care.jpg"/>
